## What is a Flexbox?

- Responsive/Mobile Friendly
- Helps you align/position child elements of a container.
- Works on items in a container
- A 2D way to organize/align

## What is CSS Grid?

- Another Responsive/Mobile friendly way to organize.
- Main goal is to POSITION things rather than ALIGN them (but it can do both)
- Also works in a container
- 3D way to organize/align

## Instructions

These files contain A BUNCH of stuff. If you're my student the way it works is the grid.html has the style on the html page. You can uncomment things and see how they work with CSS Grid.

The index.html has the HTML for flexboxes and all of the flexbox styling is in the flexbox.css. Again, things are commented out so you can uncomment them and see how they work.

Feel free to play around with this! This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to these two things and there's so much more you can do.

## Additional Resources

Here's some links that helped my learn this stuff, all for free!

This is a video I found SUPER useful when teaching myself Flexbox Stuff. Traversy is a really great teacher and you should check out his channel for more helpful videos.
